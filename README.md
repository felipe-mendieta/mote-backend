## Architecture
We base the project's architecture on CLEAN ARCHITECTURE.

└── Frameworks, Web: Frontend en Angular
  ├── Controllers: routes, middlewares
    ├─── Use Cases: services
      ├─── Entities: entities
 
```
- Entities: Enterprise Business Rules. Core entities of our business. Example: Poll, Question, User, etc.
- Use Cases: Application Business Rules. All logic related to the business.
- Controllers: Interface Adapters. They provide access.
- Web: Frameworks and Drivers.

This layered architecture follows this schema:

Controllers (Routes, Middlewares) <-> Services <-> Libs(Models)

### Workflow

#### Controllers: Contain routes and middlewares.
- Controllers access the services layer.

#### Services: Where the business logic is located.
- Services use libraries.

- Libraries are responsible for interacting with the entities layer.
- Libraries interact with other data sources: external API or database.

#### Middlewares
The middleware flow is as follows:
Request -> Middlewares -> Response

### Entities

- User: Collection of users.
- Poll: Collection of surveys.
- Question: Collection of survey questions.
- Record-Activity: Collection of activities that the user performs during the class.
- Room: Collection of rooms created for users.
